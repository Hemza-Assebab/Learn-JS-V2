/* Web APIs Explained */
/*
    -A Web API (Web Application Programming Interface) is a set of built-in features provided by the browser
     (not JavaScript itself) that allows JavaScript to interact with the web browser, system, or the internet

    -JavaScript alone is a small language, Web APIs make it powerful by giving it access to things like
     the web page, user input, the internet, and more

    -In Short: Web APIs are tools given by the browser to help JavaScript interact with the outside world
*/

/* What do Web APIs do ? */
/*
    -They let JavaScript:

    # Interact with the DOM (Document Object Model)
    # Handle events
    # Work with HTTP requests
    # Use timing functions
    # Access local storage
    # Work with geolocation, notifications, canvas, and more
*/

/* How does it relate to JavaScript ? */
// JavaScript calls these Web APIs when you write things like:
window.alert("Hello !");
fetch("http://localhost:3000");
document.body;
// The browser runs the API code outside JavaScript and gives the results back
